# Hate-speech-detection-
A Deep Learning-based NLP Model for Detecting Hate Speech in Text Data

Overview
This project is a Hate Speech Detection Model built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning. It analyzes text inputs to classify them as hate speech, offensive language, or neutral speech. The model is trained on a labeled dataset to enhance online content moderation and prevent toxic communication.

Key Features
✅ Deep Learning-Based Text Classification – Uses LSTMs, Transformers, or CNNs for accurate detection.
✅ Preprocessing Techniques – Includes tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
✅ Dataset Handling – Trained on annotated hate speech datasets.
✅ Evaluation Metrics – Utilizes accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall to assess model performance.
